Over the next eight years, their relationship unfolded across different places and chapters of life, eventually bringing them back to London, where they built a home together with their cat, Lailah.</h6>
    <h6>After returning to Florence to celebrate their fifth anniversary, getting engaged in Venice, and with family and friends spread across the US, Russia, the UK and beyond, Italy felt like the perfect place to bring everyone together.</h6>
